          Measure your water at this temperature
          to achieve your desired dough temperature.
          
          This simple change will improve your bread.
          
          Until you have determined the correct
          friction factor, measure the temperature
          of the final dough as it comes off the mixer.
          
          If the actual temperature differs from the
          desired dough temperature, use the settings
          to either directly adjust the friction factor
          or to record the actual temperature and let
          the app calculate the friction factor for you.
