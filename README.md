This is a small project to calculate Water temperature for a given dough temp

I make no claims that it works or is any way something you should use or even enjoy.

There is a toggle so that you can calculate the water temperature for doughs with or without preferments.

If you enter the desired dough temperature and temps of the flour, water, friction, and, if appropriate, the preferment the temperature of the water will be calculated.

If you would rather the app learn the friction factor for your machine, toggle that switch and take the temperature of the resulting dough.

Currently (and perhaps forever) the temp ranges are in F not C.
