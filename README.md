This is a small project to calculate Water temperature for a given dough temp

I make no claims that it works or is any way something you should use or even enjoy.

There is a toggle so that you can calculate the water temperature for doughs with or without preferments.

If you enter the desired dough temperature and temps of the flour, water, friction, and, if appropriate, the preferment the temperature of the water will be calculated.

The app supports both F and C.

# Instructions

Enter the Desired Dough Temperature.

The ideal range is 75 - 78 ยบ F  or 24 - 25.5 ยบ C.

Enter room temperature as the ambient value and also enter your flour temp. 

If there's a preferment, toggle the switch and enter its temperature. 

As you move any slider, the Water temperature is updated.

Measure your water at this temperature to achieve your desired dough temperature.

This simple change will improve your bread.

Until you have determined the correct friction factor, measure the temperature of the final dough as it comes off the mixer.

If the actual temperature differs from the desired dough temperature, use the slider in Settings to  adjust the friction factor.

To tune the friction factor, measure the actual dough temperature.

If the actual dough temperature is higher than the desired dough
temperature, increase the friction by that amount to compensate
next time. 

If the actual dough temperature is lower, decrease the friction by that amount to compensate next time.

After a couple of bakes, your friction factor should be close enough.
